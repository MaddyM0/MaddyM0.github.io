<!-- A PokéDirectory where users can enter in a pokémons name and return name, abilities, height and weight in the transparent pokédex. The user will then see a photo of the pokemon they looked up as well.  -->

<!-- Future fixes/ add-ons - I'm hoping to add on sound effects per click and adding a larger variety of pokemon options and not having my project be case - sensitive when it comes to the user entering in pokemon names . -->
