A PokéDirectory where users can enter in a pokémons name and return name, abilities, height and weight in the transparent pokédex. The user will then see a photo of the pokemon they looked up as well. 

Future fixes/ add-ons - I'm hoping to add on sound effects per click and adding a larger variety of pokemon options and not having my project be case - sensitive when it comes to the user entering in pokemon names .  I definitely need to have a better way to fit the larger pokemon into the screen without them overlapping into the pokedex. I would also like to look into more "transitional" movements when clicking the "about pokedirectory" such as a fade .
