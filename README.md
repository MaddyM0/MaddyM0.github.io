A PokéDirectory where users can enter in a pokémons name and return name, abilities, height and weight in the transparent pokédex. The user will then see a photo of the pokemon they looked up on the pokédex. 

User has the option to click "About PokéDirectory" which will give them a summary of the application and a direct link to the API used in the project for a list of pokémon.

Future fixes/ add-ons - I'm hoping to add on sound effects per click and adding a larger variety of pokemon options and not having my project be case - sensitive when it comes to the user entering in pokemon names .  I definitely need to have a better way to fit the larger pokemon into the screen without them overlapping into the pokedex. I would also like to look into more "transitional" movements when clicking the "about pokedirectory" such as a fade .
